# enron-email-databricks-spark-analysis
Group assessment project for MSc Data Science involving big data analysis on the Enron email dataset using Databricks and Apache Spark.

## ðŸ“„ Overview
This project was developed as part of a group assessment for the MSc Data Science program at the University of Salford. The objective was to analyze the semi-structured Enron email dataset using Apache Spark on Databricks Community Edition.

The dataset contains over 500,000 email records and demonstrates Big Data characteristics such as volume, variety, and semi-structured complexity.

## ðŸ“Œ Assessment Requirements
We completed four analysis questions as a group:
- ðŸ“Š 1 Easy: e.g. calculating mean number of emails sent per sender.
- ðŸ“Š 2 Medium: e.g. top senders/recipients, domain filtering, internal emails, etc.
- ðŸ“Š 3 Difficult: e.g. word frequency analysis on subject lines, or daily email trends visualized.

## ðŸ”§ Tools & Technologies
- Apache Spark (DataFrames and RDDs)
- Databricks Community Edition
- Python (for data transformations and cleaning)
- Databricks File System (DBFS)

## ðŸ“ˆ Key Deliverables
- Databricks notebooks with complete code solutions.
- Screen recording video walkthrough explaining technical implementation, results, assumptions, and group reflections.
- Data processing included cleaning, schema inference, and multiline CSV handling due to semi-structured content.
